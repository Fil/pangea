# M4 line simplification

## implemented in DuckDB

An implementation of [M4](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/m4-scalable-time-series-visualization), a line simplification algorithm for time series, using DuckDB’s [UNNEST](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/query_syntax/unnest.html) operator. Data: [Max-Planck-Institut für Biogeochemie, Jena](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/)

${Plot.line(series, {x: "u", y: "v", strokeWidth: 0.5, stroke: color ? "k" : "currentColor"}).plot({color: {type: "categorical"}})}

(${d3.format(",")(series.numRows)} / <strong>${d3.format(",")(count)}</strong> points.)

```js
const f = sql`FROM climate LIMIT 1`
```

```sql id=[{count}]
SELECT COUNT() count FROM climate
```

```js
const x = view(Inputs.select(["Date Time"], {label: "x"}));
const y = view(Inputs.select([...Object.keys(f.get(0))].slice(1), {label: "y", value: "p (mbar)"}));
const k = view(Inputs.select(["1 day", "1 week", "1 month", "6 months", "1 year"], {label: "bucket", value: "1 week"}));
const color = view(Inputs.toggle({label: "color by bucket"}));
```

```js
const series = sql([`
WITH pts AS (
  SELECT "${x}" u, "${y}" v, TIME_BUCKET(INTERVAL '${k}', "${x}") AS k
    FROM climate
)
FROM (
  SELECT k,
        UNNEST([
          {u: MIN(u), v: ARG_MIN(v, u)}
        , {u: ARG_MIN(u, v), v: MIN(v)}
        , {u: ARG_MAX(u, v), v: MAX(v)}
        , {u: MAX(u), v: ARG_MAX(v, u)}
       ], max_depth := 2)
    FROM pts
  GROUP BY k
) ORDER BY u;
`]);
```

```sql run=false
WITH pts AS (
  SELECT '{x}' AS u
       , '{y}' AS v
       , TIME_BUCKET(INTERVAL '{k}', '{x}') AS k
    FROM climate
)
FROM (
  SELECT k,
        UNNEST([
          {u: MIN(u), v: ARG_MIN(v, u)}
        , {u: ARG_MIN(u, v), v: MIN(v)}
        , {u: ARG_MAX(u, v), v: MAX(v)}
        , {u: MAX(u), v: ARG_MAX(v, u)}
       ], max_depth := 2)
    FROM pts
  GROUP BY k
) ORDER BY u;
```

Compared to the original implementation, this guarantees exactly 4 points per time bucket, and keeps the definition of the bucket in one place.

It’s similar to `AM4` (implemented below), using `ARG_MIN` and `ARG_MAX` to locate the extrema, as in [Mosaic](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2024-Mosaic-TVCG.pdf) for reference. Even though it has 4 `SELECT` statements, `AM4` is probably faster than the `UNNEST` version.

```sql run=false
WITH pts AS (
  SELECT '{x}' AS u, '{y}' AS v, TIME_BUCKET(INTERVAL '{k}', '{x}') AS k
    FROM climate
)

  SELECT k, MIN(u) AS u, ARG_MIN(v, u) AS v
    FROM pts
   GROUP BY k
UNION
  SELECT k, ARG_MIN(u, v) AS u, MIN(v) AS v
    FROM pts
   GROUP BY k
UNION
  SELECT k, ARG_MAX(u, v) AS u, MAX(v) AS v
    FROM pts
   GROUP BY k
UNION
  SELECT k, MAX(u) AS u, ARG_MAX(v, u) AS v
    FROM pts
   GROUP BY k

ORDER BY u;
```

```js
for (const q of document.querySelectorAll(".language-sql span")) {
  if (q.textContent.match(/^'{(x|y|k)}'$/)) {
    q.classList.add("replacer-" + q.textContent.charAt(2));
  }
}
for (const q of document.querySelectorAll(".replacer-x")) q.textContent = JSON.stringify(x);
for (const q of document.querySelectorAll(".replacer-y")) q.textContent = JSON.stringify(y);
for (const q of document.querySelectorAll(".replacer-k")) q.textContent = `'${k}'`;
```
