# Sorted heatmap

[Grouping](https://observablehq.com/plot/transforms/group) by _x_ (hour of day) and _y_ (location) produces a heatmap. Locations are [sorted](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/scales#sort-mark-option) by the maximum highway traffic (measured as vehicles per hour) they have during the day. Data: [Christopher MÃ¶ller](https://gist.github.com/chrtze).

```js echo
const chart = Plot.plot({
  marginLeft: 120,
  padding: 0,
  y: {label: null},
  color: {legend: true, zero: true},
  marks: [
    Plot.cell(
      traffic,
      Plot.group(
        {fill: "median"},
        {
          x: (d) => d.date.getUTCHours(),
          y: "location",
          fill: "vehicles",
          inset: 0.5,
          sort: {y: "fill"}
        }
      )
    )
  ]
});

display(chart);
```

```js echo
const traffic = FileAttachment("../data/traffic.csv").csv({typed: true});
