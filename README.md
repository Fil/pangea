# Pangea

This Observable Framework project allows me to test different things, for example to port “classic” D3 and Plot notebooks to dark mode, or to play with new features such as sql fenced code.

As I write this, the _main_ branch gets deployed to https://pangea-proxima.vercel.app/ (on each commit), and the _sane_ branch to https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/pangea/ (from time to time). This is subject to change at any time, as it’s mostly experimental stuff.

I don’t guarantee that something you find today will be here tomorrow (in fact, quite the opposite). So if you see something interesting, use it—but probably don't link to it if you want the link to persist. You can check what license a page has by going to the _source_ mentioned. If there is no source, or the source has no license, reach out to me and I’ll clarify.

The contents is not structured (yet), you have to search.
